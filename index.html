                    <p>I make stuff. That simplifies it really. But I take pieces of fabric or long lengths of wool and make something completely different. I can make you a shirt or a blanket out of flannel. I can make you a doll with a hand embroidered face or a pillow that only goes on "the good couch." If you are lucky, I will spend hours making a one-of-a-kind quilt for your child. I don't have a great skill: I have extreme patience and a desire to learn something new every single day.</p>
                    <p>I hope to take the skills from my passion and join them with the skills of my previous careers and make something entirely new. I believe that my experience can manifest into an application in which the functions are intuitive and effective.</p>
                    <p>Times may be tumultuous, but the world always surprises you. This year I celebrated a milestone birthday I was told I wouldn't see and will soon be watching my son accept his Eagle rank and graduate from high school. It can't end if every day is just a new beginning.
